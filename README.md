# CrewAI-powered Debate System

A multi-agent AI system built with [CrewAI](https://crewai.com) that simulates structured debates between AI debaters and a judge.  
Each agent performs a specific role, one argues *for* a motion, another *against*, and a third agent acts as a judge deciding the winner based on argument quality.

## Features
- Multi-agent debate simulation (Proposer, Opposer, and Judge)
- Sequential task execution using CrewAIâ€™s `Process.sequential`
- Configurable YAML setup for agents and tasks (`agents.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`)
- Natural language arguments generated by LLMs
- Judge reasoning output summarizing which side was more convincing

## How It Works
1. The **Proposer Agent** argues in favor of the given motion.  
2. The **Opposer Agent** argues against it.  
3. The **Judge Agent** evaluates both arguments and delivers a verdict.  

All agents and tasks are defined in YAML configs and orchestrated through `crew.py`.
